A Different Nature Mission Statement: A Sustained Explorations of New, Experimental Music and Sonic Art
A Different Nature is a curatorial program of genre-defying avant garde music and spoken word that champions historic and modern sound art and spotlights, new, emergent experimental music and audio art generally not heard anywhere else.
The program's format provides the space for deep listening to pieces not confined to pop song lengths and shows are generally focused on an artist, school of music or discipline, record label or art movement.

A Different Nature is a collaborative effort of the ADN Collective, who each curate a show every week on an informal rotating basis, or a group show, depending on the subject at hand.

A Different Nature was founded in the late Seventies by Richard Francis, who fearlessly championed new music and the unheard Avant Garde. His programs went into exhaustive detail on individual artists, labels and musical disciplines. He also spearheaded many important events on the air, such as the 2001 and 2008 Dada and Surrealism festivals that dominated the airwaves for days on end and involved many in the local avant garde community as well as many KBOO programmers.
Richard passed away in 2009 but it's our hope to carry on with his mission of introducing listeners to unheard new music as a collective of his collaborators and listeners.
Long live Papa Dada!

http://kboo.fm/program/beloved-community,Beloved Community,Current,Resources for Activism,"In his 1959 Sermon on Gandhi, Dr. King said:

“The aftermath of nonviolence is the creation of the beloved community, so that when the battle’s over, a new relationship comes into being between the oppressed and the oppressor….The way of violence leads to bitterness in the survivors and brutality in the destroyers. But, the way of non-violence leads to redemption and the creation of the beloved community.”

On “The Beloved Community” we address the philosophical and spiritual foundations for non-violence, activism, political engagement and peace building. We also hear voices of those who are building the beloved community right here in Portland. The goal is to gain inspiration, solidarity, wisdom, and insight for your own activism.

We live in an empire that began 500 years ago with the European conquest of the Americas. This program looks at how the empire permeates our lives.

 

What are we doing in the world? What are we doing to the world?

George Kennan was an influential US diplomat during the Cold War years. It was he who devised the containment strategy against the Soviet Union (as opposed to a more aggressive rollback policy). In February 1948 Kennan presented a document to President Truman, Presidential Policy Statement #23, which includes the following:

""The US has  50 percent of the world's wealth, but only 6.3 percent of its population. Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which permits us to maintain this position of disparity...To do so we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and day-dreaming, and our attention will have to be concentrated everywhere on our immediate national objectives.

""We should cease to talk about vague and unreal objectives such as human rights, the raising of living standards, and democratization. The day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts. The less we are hampered by idealistic slogans the better.""

Some have claimed that Kennan was speaking as a foreign policy ""realist,"" and arguing against an ideological anti-Communist crusade. That may be so, but his words are clear, as Noam Chomsky has pointed out. The US intends to keep for itself an unfair share of the world's resources. The main difference between the realists and the ideologues is one of tactics in pursuing this ignoble goal.

		DJ Anjali and The Incredible Kid have spent more than a decade igniting dance floors with cutting edge music not limited by borders or language. They host the longest-running Bhangra and Bollywood party on the West Coast, co-founded the Pacific Northwest’s first Global Bass dance party and host two weekly radio shows onXRAY.FM and KBOO.FM. Few DJs can be said to have changed the sound of their city but that is exactly what DJ Anjali and The Incredible Kid have accomplished since they first introduced Portland, Oregon nightclub audiences to the many varied sounds of Global Bass at a raucous New Year’s Eve debut in 2000. They are most known for incinerating dance floors with the heavy dance floor artillery of South Asia, but the duo scour the globe for any hard-hitting music that combines local music traditions with window-rattling production. Anjali and The Kid regularly perform at festivals including five sets at the Sasquatch! Music Festival tenth anniversary where they headlined the dance tent opening night. They have performed at festivals such as Decibel, MusicfestNW, Vancouver International Bhangra Celebration, Beloved, Photosynthesis, Fairytale, Kaleidoscope and the Vancouver Queer Film Festival. The duo travel to perform in cities such as New York City, Chicago, Washington DC, San Francisco and Vancouver, BC to headline parties such as Basement Bhangra, iBomba, Bhangrateque, Ottomania and Non Stop Bhangra.
		 
		After making a name for themselves in their hometown’s raucous house party circuit, DJ Anjali & The Incredible Kid introduced the Portland, Oregon nightclub scene to the sounds of Bhangra, Bollywood and Global Bass on New Year’s Eve 2000. A series of residencies followed, beginning with a night at the legendary Blackbird, and the duo began hosting their ANDAZ dance parties in July of 2002. The party’s focus on hardcore Panjabi Bhangra and the latest electronic confections from the Bollywood film industry continue to pack the dance floor after 12 years. While ANDAZ was still in the bloom of youth, Anjali and The Kid founded the revolutionary dance night ATLAS (with co-host/DJ E3) at Holocene in November of 2003 to introduce Portland to Global Bass sounds such as: Balkan Beats, Reggaeton, Funk Carioca,  3Ball Guarachero, Digital Cumbia, Urban Desi, French and Arabic Hip-Hop, Rai N B, Reggada, Dembow, Dubstep, Kuduro, Merengue Urbano and a host of other local and diasporic future musics. ATLAS was a vital party in Portland nightlife and the Global Bass scene internationally for more than nine years and remains the longest-running night in Holocene’s history. In 2013 Anjali and The Kid initiated TROPITAAL: A Desi Latino Soundclash, their latest project.
		 
		They have supported artists as diverse as A Tribe Called Red, Tigerstyle, Balkan Beat Box, Major Lazer, Skrillex, Flying Lotus, Saini Surinder, Digable Planets, Delhi 2 Dublin, Sleigh Bells, Glitch Mob, Dengue Fever, Blockhead, Uproot Andy, Hindi Zahra, Toy Selectah, Quantic, Opiuo, Bonobo, Gold Panda, Maga Bo, Poirier, Plastician, Kultur Shock, Ghostland Observatory, State of Bengal, Karsh Kale, DJ Rekha, DJ Spooky, CeU, Antibalas, Nickodemus & Joro-Boro.

http://kboo.fm/program/kitchen-table-conversations,Kitchen Table Conversations,Current,Every first Wednesday of the month from 6:00 pm - 7:00 pm," 

Kitchen Table Conversations is a spontaneous, Live talk radio program focused on discussing important current events and how they are impacting our community and all of us individually. This is not a new concept! I, Mary Postlethwaite, started Kitchen Table Conversation as a series on Bread and Roses, a feminist public affairs show that airs on the KBOO airwaves every Friday at 6:00PM. I am a real, honest, authentic person who loves to connect on a human level with people because I believe everyone has a story to tell. Kitchen Table Conversations has become a way for the KBOO audience to know the Bread and Roses collective members on a more personal level and realize we are real people, just like them! What an honor it would be to expend Kitchen Table Conversations to a monthly show of its own that fosters casual conversations amongst regular people, that models positivity, inclusion, open-minded and realness and that explores grassroots efforts to change our community for the better, one life at a time!

Kitchen Table Conversations has also been and will continue to be a forum for our youth. What is going on with our young people, especially those who live in my community in North Portland is hugely important to me and this is why I invite youth to share their thoughts, opinions and ideas with our KBOO audience, as well as their art and talents on my show often. I believe that some of the best talent goes unheard and unseen and so I feature young artists on the shows who I believe have a huge potential to blow up in the future.

Kitchen Table Conversations is solution oriented show that is intended to be informative, real and fun!

Pacific Underground is a show by Asians and Pacific Islanders (APIs) taking the mic into our own hands.

There are nearly 225,000 APIs in Oregon. But in one of America’s whitest states, the issues that impact us simply aren’t covered. Imagine: 225,000 stories untold.

Stay tuned here for interviews, documentaries, audio essays, performances, as well as real-time coverage of national social, economic and political issues affecting APIs in your local community. 

Since the end of the only Pacific Northwest API public affairs radio program, APA Compass, there has been a lack of API representation in Oregon media. We believe that by creating a public platform in which APIs can tell our stories in a way that reflects our actual experiences, 

we empower our communities, 
	we expand our reach in spaces previously denied to us and 
	we honor the legacy of generations before us who have been left out of American narratives.
Pacific Underground is holding space for API community members who want to be heard. If you want to join us, email pacificunderground@kboo.org. No experience necessary.

 Healing Our World

Everywhere we look we see a world in trouble--environmental degradation; war, torture and militarism; corporate greed, poverty and economic injustice;  a negligent media--and all of it intertwined.  Yet there are also people dedicated to solving these problems--working on them from every possible angle.  They are part of a leaderless, bottom up, grass roots social movement manifesting itself in a myriad of ways. Paul Hawken describes this movement as humanity's ""immune response""  to the sickness that pervades our world -- ""social antibodies attaching themselves to the pathologies of power.""  The Recovery Zone gives voice to these healers.

http://kboo.fm/program/red-eye-sunrise,Red Eye Sunrise,Current,Night Music,"Airs 12:00am (midnight) to 3:00am Wednesdays. Alternates weekly with Somethin or Other.

""A Late Night Radio Show that plays Night Music:
Music that wakes up when the sun goes down
Music that sounds like the electronic building blocks of society
Music that makes you remember to never forget
Music that draws you to the light on that intercontinental flight
It's That Show.""

That was the original pitch for Red Eye Sunrise, and the show continues on its pursuit of crafting eclectic soundtracks from electronic bands and artists from the late 1970s to today. Typically broken into three segments, the first hour tends to skew upbeat alternative electronic dance, ranging from deep house to tech house, from electro to nu disco. The second segment gets deeper, darker, and more introspective, where you might hear an early 1980s synthetic torch song in between a trip hop classic and something from DFA. The third hour generally comes from Guilterre's own vinyl vault, where, let's face it, there's a lot of 1980s extended remixes in there...

Frequent guest DJs mix things up a bit.

About the host: Producer/DJ Charles Guilterre has called creative hotspots NYC and LA as home. Widely known for his Hump Wednesday parties in New York City's East Village in the late 1990s, his electronic sound incorporates elements of lounge, experimental, electro, synthwave, heady house, and a hint of industrial, the latter heavily influenced by music from Chicago's WaxTrax! label from the mid-1980s. He currently lives in Portland, OR, collaborating on house production/remixing projects as part of his House of Fronds production team/label, and is in the studio working on a new release for his experimental electro outfit Fallen Fronds.

Nick Towle and Logan Manser are originally from California

Portland. They highlight some of those loves in their radio program, playing and

reviewing music by local acts, and speaking on local events and topics. Their

music is as eclectic as the residents of this city, often highlighting shows that are

current in the local music scene. The Dawn Patrol began three years ago at
